# switch-theme-antd: a simple create-react-app configuration for switch themes, using antd ui library.

This is a simple configuration project for a create-react-app project.

## Configs
Change the `.less` files in `/themes` folder, using the [variables antd](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/blob/master/components/style/themes/default.less).

Runing in dev mode or building a bundle file with react scrits, it will automatically compile all styles and append it in to the `public/css` folder.

>Note: changing between themes is a css injection in `index.html` file.

Enjoy! ðŸ‘‹
